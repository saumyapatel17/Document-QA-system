Unused vacation time can be carried over to the following year or the company may elect to pay for the unused time. For states except California, Colorado, Montana, and Nebraska, vacation time received each year is based on length of service and is granted either in a lump sum at the beginning of each year or according to an accrual schedule up to a maximum annual grant. Specific amounts for each employment year are provided in the policy."

However, it's important to note that the specific terms of employment and termination are governed by the state laws where the employee is based. Also, the handbook and company documents do not guarantee continued employment, contractual rights, or specific termination reasons.
